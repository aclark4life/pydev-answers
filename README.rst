Can you tell us a little about yourself (hobbies, education, etc):
================================================================================

I've been calling myself a "Python Web Developer" professionally for the last 10 years or so, occasionally adding "& Musician" to the end; so music is a big part of what I do, or at least think about doing, outside of Python. I'm from Baltimore, MD and I attended both Loyola High School and University (College when I attended) in Maryland. It took about 10 years, but I earned my Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science in May of 1998. Not all who wander are lost, but in my case I had no idea what I wanted to do until I saw a room full of Digital DECStations in the UNIX lab; at that moment, I decided I wanted to be in that room and I switched my major from Accounting to Computer Science.
